## üöÄ What I Do

I specialize in the end-to-end data lifecycle, from cleaning and analysis to building predictive models and delivering insights that drive strategy. My approach is rooted in statistical rigor and a focus on solving real-world business problems.

```python
class DataAnalyst:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Sachin Kanchan"

        self.skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Tableau", "Power BI", "Alteryx", "Snowflake"]

        self.machine_learning = {
            "Supervised": ["Regression", "Random Forest", "XGBoost", "SVM"],
            "Unsupervised": ["K-Means Clustering", "PCA"],
            "LLM Techniques": ["Prompt Engineering", "RAG"]
        }

    def get_expertise(self):
        return {
            "Data Analysis & BI": "Deriving insights from complex datasets and creating interactive dashboards.",
            "Predictive Modeling": "Building models to forecast trends, predict outcomes, and classify data.",
            "Process Optimization": "Using data to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for cost savings."
        }
```
